# Vigenere Cipher Project
> **Important** this project does not protect against invalid inputs

Only input lowercase or capital **letters** for the plaintext and key, no punctuation.
Do not enter numbers for anything other than the menu decision.
## Purpose of this project
This project was a way to implement a vigenere cipher to encode and decode messages.
It also helped me learn how brute force attacks work, and how they are affected by a longer keylength
This project was a part of my *EECS 565 Introduction to Information and Computer Security* Class.
## How to run
1. `make` to compile the project
2. `./MP1` to run the project
3. `make clean` to remove the executables

You will be presented with a menu when you first run the program.
You need to enter a number to select what you want to do.
